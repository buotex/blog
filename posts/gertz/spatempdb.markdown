#Basics

##Queries

**Split by dimensionality**

- Moving point (point, sequence)
- Country borders (region/ period)
- Other combinations of point/region vs instance/sequence/period

**Split by querytype**

- NN queries
- Selection queries
- Aggregate queries
- Join queries
- SImilarity queries



##Representations in 3D+t

- Moving points create **trajectories**, which can be modelled by e.g. linear interpolation
