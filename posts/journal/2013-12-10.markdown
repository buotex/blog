Daily task:
Create an implementation of a todo-list!

{{#todo_block}}
- [+] Create an implementation of a todo-list
- [+] Every todo should be tickable via the browser
- [+] The file itself should be as clean as possible
- [+] Thus, implementation via mustache code blocks, plugins/todolist/todo.rb
  wrap around todoblocks with the {{#todo_block}}{{/todo_block}} syntax and puts a link 
  into every []
- [+] Run script serverside which handles the api queries produced by the aforementioned links
- [+] That script runs on another port (8888), thus we have to switch the port in
  the queries via javascript
- [+] To do automatic refreshing, the server replies with a blank html page which
  redirects back to the original (though with a ticked todo) page.
- [+] Fixed the automatic update of dates in the markdown headers

{{/todo_block}}
