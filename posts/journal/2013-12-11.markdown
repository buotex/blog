So today marks about one week since the inception of the blog, and now it has
fancy features!
As I yesterday wrote the first plugin, todolists are now implemented (and
hopefully pushed into git...
Actually, let's use vim to check that~
To do that (and to remind myself), just use :Gstatus while in the git
repository, and press ``-`` to add or remove files from the commit, which can be
done via :Gcommit.
...Is it possible to pass a commit message as well during that time? Let's use
:help Gcommit!
Anyway, time to write something about my actual studying.
