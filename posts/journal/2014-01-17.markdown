Well, while today wasn't very productive, I found a new vim plugin!
It is time to check out snipmate along with vim-snippets - the latter will stay, while there are
several implementations which could perform differently for extracting these snippets, whereas the
current choice may not be the best one (snipmate).
On a sidenote: vim-snippets actually ships with ultrasnip?
