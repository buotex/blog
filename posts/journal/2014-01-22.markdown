New idea: Let's design a MMR system to gamify studying/etc. vs yourself!

- Based on todo list
- random task is selected via matchmaking system (ok, just randomly pick something)
- if done well, give yourself +points, otherwise -
- log activities, can make statistics out of that, plot mmr!
- difficulty level? implement later
- should group up activities somehow? - also later
- some research says that it's easier to make a "done" instead of a "todo" list, but this isn't
equal to gaming experience
- Can use something like a topic list, create a virtual challenge: goal is in a stretch of time to
- solve challenge


Example: Topic list for studying rdb, every challenge block searches for one topic, goal is to be
able to answer questions regarding that topic.

New approach: Find something VERY important to do - and don't do it so we can work on less important
things.

I guess the most important thing to do now would be studying, so the less important one is writing
some code.
