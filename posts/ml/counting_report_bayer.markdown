#Results
- Automated seeding on microscope images give a much better estimate of the count compared to
  connected components
- We can replicate the results on the camera images within a 5-10% error tolerance, using the
  seeds from the microscope images
- We have a faster heuristic, with barely a cost in prediction power

#Issues with non-circular objects
